    "text": "Vast Challenge 2023\nSeafood is one of the most extensively traded commodities in the global food market. Over one-third of the global population depends on fish and other types of seafood as their main source of protein, while approximately 520 million individuals derive their livelihoods from fishing or activities related to fishing.\nRegrettably, the issue of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing has emerged as a significant contributor to overfishing on a global scale. These illicit practices not only endanger delicate marine ecosystems but also jeopardize food security within coastal communities and overall regional stability. The illegal fishing trade is closely associated with organized crime, and the absence of regulatory oversight often leads to human rights violations during fishing operations.\nFishEye International, an impartial non-governmental organization, has the responsibility of comprehending the societal, political, and economic factors that propel the illicit fishing industry. Through several years of dedicated effort, they have gathered data with the aim of constructing a more inclusive understanding of this ever-changing menace.\nOur project aim to use some of the datasets provided by FishEye and apply visual analytics to identify companies that are possibly engaged in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\nMore information can be found at the link: Mini Challenge 3: VAST challenge 2023"

    "text": "Motivation\nFishEye International, a non-profit organization dedicated to combatting the scourge of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, has been granted access to fishing-related companies’ financial database, offered by an international finance corporation. Through their previous investigations, FishEye has discovered that companies with unusual arrangements are more likely to be engaged in IUU activities or other questionable practices. To leverage this valuable resource, FishEye has transformed the database into a comprehensive knowledge graph, which encompasses data on companies, owners, workers and revenue.\nThe primary objective of our project is to employ this graph to detect irregularities that may indicate a company’s involvement in IUU fishing.\n\n\nDataset\nDataset contains the knowledge graph with 27,622 nodes and 24,038 edges:\nNode Attributes:\n\ntype – Type of node as defined above.\ncountry – Country associated with the entity. This can be a full country or a two-letter country code.\nproduct_services – Description of product services that the \"id\" node does.\nrevenue_omu – Operating revenue of the \"id\" node in Oceanus Monetary Units.\nid – Identifier of the node is also the name of the entry.\nrole – The subset of the \"type\" node, not in every node attribute.\n\nEdge Attributes:\n\ntype – Type of the edge as defined above.\nsource – ID of the source node.\ntarget – ID of the target node.\ndataset – Always \"MC3\".\nrole - The subset of the \"type\" node, not in every edge attribute.\n\n\n\nRelated works\n\n\nApproach and Shiny App Prototype\n\nQuestion 1: Use visual analytics to identify anomalies in the business groups present in the knowledge graph.\nBased on the product services, we will filter out companies who are involved in fishing related services and classify them into different business groups. We can use network graph to plot the relationship of the entities (companies, beneficial owners, and workers) for each business type. We will perform different centrality measures such as degree, betweenness and eigenvector centrality, and compute an overall score to evaluate the importance of the node. The score could be used to determine the size of the node in the network graph.\n\n\nQuestion 2: Develop a visual analytics process to find similar businesses and group them. This analysis should focus on a business's most important features and present those features clearly to the user.\nNext, we can also perform community detection to identify clusters or groups with the knowledge graph for different business types. We could pick out the leader of the node in each community and plot its ego-network graph to see its activities with other companies.\n\n\n\nQuestion 3: Measure similarity of businesses that you group in the previous question.\nWe measure companies with similar product services using cosine similarities, and\nUsing either Jaccard, Adamic-Adar or SimRank to identify companies with similar connections in relative to other nodes in the overall network graph.\n\npacman::p_load(jsonlite, tidyverse)\n\n\nMC3<-fromJSON('data/MC3.json')"
